# ImRep Companion

Here we provide scripts and commands we used in our study "Profiling immunoglobulin repertoires across multiple human tissues by RNA Sequencing"  to run existing Ig and TCR repertoire assembly tools on both simulated and real data. Preprint  of the study is available at http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/11/22/089235

# Reproducing results

## Tools

We have compared ImRep to the following repertoire assembly tools:

* MIXCR (v 2.2), http://mixcr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
* IMSEQ (v 1.1.0), http://www.imtools.org/
* IGBLAST pipeline (version information is not available), https://github.com/nbstrauli/influenza_vaccination_project

Additional details on how we ran these tools can be found in our supplementary ["README"](https://github.com/Mangul-Lab-USC/imrep-companion/tree/master/supplementary)
